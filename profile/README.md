# Welcome to ErgoSum's GitHub!

We are excited to share our work with you on GitHub. ErgoSum was founded in 2010 by Nilay Parikh ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niparikh/)) and Niketa Parikh ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niketa-parikh/)), a dedicated academic and educator. We are based in the United Kingdom and India.

Our initial focus was on developing products for e-commerce vendors to provide safe temporary cookie management between referrers and advertisers, using unique proprietary P2P token exchange. We extended this domain into consumer insights, behavior analysis and pattern recognition. 

We built the initial stages of machine learning algorithms to identify fraud patterns, web scrapers, and other non-human-like activities based on web traffic and movements.

Our research and development focuses on Time Series, Algorithmic Trading, Pattern and Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence solutions. 

We are currently actively developing modern algorithmic trading platforms, and rediscovering research in the fields of time series and data engineering.
